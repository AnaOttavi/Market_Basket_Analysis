**BUSINESS NEEDS**

Due to the intense competition in the restaurant industry, Cyprus' C's Asian food brand is having difficulty sustaining both growth and a profit margin. The client, therefore, provided their transactions data to better understand customer trends and preferences in order to address these difficulties.

**BACKGROUND**

The restaurant business has become increasingly competitive, therefore, companies like C's Asian Food must adapt to changing market dynamics as the adage "if I build it, they will come" no longer holds true. When developing plans, C needs to consider a number of factors, including how dine-in and delivery clients differ, how to evaluate the available products, and how to spot trends in consumer behavior. Through this project, a set of menus will be developed, new items will be introduced, alternative products will be understood, and cross-selling and up-selling will be encouraged.

**BUSINESS OBJECTIVES**

C's main business objectives are to maintain profitability, guarantee continuous growth, and improve the competitive position of its Asian food brand in Cyprus by taking advantage of its sales data and customer insights in order to make decisions to optimize its products, strategies, and customer patterns of consumption and preferences.

**BUSINESS SUCCESS CRITERIA**

Three significant factors have been identified in order to assess the success of C's Asian food brand. These criteria include enhanced product offers and targeted marketing campaigns to maximize profit margins, consistent sales, and customer base expansion in order to keep businesses relevant and achieve high levels of customer satisfaction.

**SITUATION ASSESSMENT**

By March 29th, we must come up with a company solution leveraging information from client transactions that satisfies a set of goals. To find patterns in customer purchasing behavior that can be used to enhance menu selection, pricing tactics, and stock control, a market basket analysis is the suggested approach. However, there are significant hazards involved in performing a market basket study, including small or non-representative sample sizes and a lack of statistical skill among restaurant managers or owners.

**DATA MINING GOALS**
The main data mining goals of our project are: creation of menu sets, the introduction of new products, the understanding of substitute products, the recommendation of cross-selling and other possible results depending on the findings.
